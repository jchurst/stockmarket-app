# Chart the Stock Market

### User stories
* I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
* I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
* I can remove stocks.
* I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
